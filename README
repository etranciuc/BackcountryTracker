BackcountryTracker was meant as a sample concept to store location (GPS) data, and be able to send that data to another person using SMS messaging. The app's core functionality has sincebeen replaced by built-in Siri 
functionality.  This app is only a concept and cannot be verified to work in an actual emergency.


USAGE OF APP:
Upon clicking the 'Settings' tab the user is taken to the settings view controller where they may add a trip name, trip location and select a contact.  

Selecting a contact opens a prompt wherein they may choose an individual from their phone contacts.  These values are stored using NSUserDefaults.  

By Clicking the 'back' button the user is taken back to the main page and the main UI element is a button reading 'HELP'.

If the user pushes that button the app will use the stored information, along with the user's current location data to create a pre-populated SMS message which is addressed to the predefined contact.

If the user pushes the tab titled 'End Trip', they will be prompted to verify they have ended their trip, at which time the stored values will be erased.
